* **[React](https://react.dev/)**: Used for building the user interface. React's component-based architecture provides a highly efficient and maintainable front-end.
* **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: Enhances code quality and maintainability by adding static typing to JavaScript. This helps catch errors during development.
* **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A fast and lightweight build tool that significantly improves the development experience for React applications.

### UI & Styling

* **[@mui/material](https://mui.com/)** and **[@emotion/react](https://emotion.sh/)**: A popular React UI library (Material-UI) combined with a powerful CSS-in-JS library for styling components, ensuring a consistent and appealing user interface.
* **[@mui/icons-material](https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/)**: Provides a comprehensive set of Material Design icons to enhance the app's visual appeal.
* **[@mui/x-date-pickers](https://mui.com/x/react-date-pickers/)** and **[dayjs](https://day.js.org/)**: Used for efficient date and time handling, making it easy to set up reminders with specific schedules.
